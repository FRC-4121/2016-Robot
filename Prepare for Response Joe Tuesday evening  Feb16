Joe Oâ€™Donnell, says:

 I created a simple system and am testing it on my desktop computer.  
 It will also take me some more time to transfer it to the raspberry pi.
 I believe I will be able to complete both of those steps by about 6 or 7 tomorrow (tuesday Feb 16) at the latest.
I will communicate it's code over Skype to the students, 

They just need a web cam to attach to the raspberry pi with Linux os.

This system will most likely be able to detect the angular direction of the castle target, and possibly it's rough height,
but I can't guarantee that before testing with a castle target of some sort by the students is done.
